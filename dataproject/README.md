# Data analysis project

This project is titled **Crop yield and weather data in North Dakota** and is about the relationship between crop yields of wheat, and weather data such as average temperature and prescipation. The data is from North Dakota, United States, and goes back about a century.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running the self-contained notebook [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb), which contains all relevant code.

I apply the **following datasets**:

1. ND_weather.csv (*https://www.noaa.gov/*) 
1. ND_yield.csv (*https://www.usda.gov/*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

seaborn
